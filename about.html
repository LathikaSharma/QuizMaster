     <h2 id = "directions">This quizmaster project was created in the 2018-2019 school year by SILC's Social Studies 4 (JavaScript) class. The students in our class range from age 13 to 30. Because of this, we assigned each individual a topic to create 20 questions for and after everyone was done we accumulated all of the questions to create a question bank of 300 questions. Next, we colated all of our code to publish our website. </h2>
